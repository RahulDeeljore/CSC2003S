n this assignment, you are required to implement collision detection and bit-checking for your game.

You will have to implement pixel perfect collision with some way of visualising the collision (i.e. could be outlines where it collides etc.)

The second part of the assignment is to improve the efficiency from O(n2).

You can also score bonus marks by implementing a better bounding-box for your objects.
